[Project1:German Credit Risk Project](https://github.com/ps1608/ps_2019/edit/master/XlriExitProject_GermanCreditRisk)
#This project aims to reduce the Expected Loss due to defaults by using a predictive classification Model,for Good and Bad Risk customers
#The likelihood of default obtained from Classification Model,goes as Input to compute expected Loss and other important Business Metrics like
#Probability of Default & Loss Given Default.
#Further classifies the customers into High Risk,Moderate Risk,Less Risk customers,so that appropriate actions can be taken. As Date of Loan or Location is not available hence #Deinquency charts or Maps are not made.

[Project2:Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/ps1608/ps_2019/tree/master/DemandForecast)
#The problem is of a retail chain which wants to use it is 3 years past data(130 weeks data)
#demand/units_sold for 28 products(skuâ€™s) across 76 stores, to predict/forecast the demand for next 
#12 weeks accurately. However, since we do not have Actual demand data for test set . the first 120
#Data will be used for all analysis and will be referred as training set  and last 10 weeks data will be
#used for measuring the performance and will be referred as validation set.
