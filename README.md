[Project2]:Demand Forecasting]https://github.com/ps1608/ps_2019/tree/master/DemandForecast
The problem is of a retail chain which wants to use it is 3 years past data(130 weeks data)
demand/units_sold for 28 products(skuâ€™s) across 76 stores, to predict/forecast the demand for next 
12 weeks accurately. However, since we do not have Actual demand data for test set . the first 120
Data will be used for all analysis and will be referred as training set  and last 10 weeks data will be
used for measuring the performance and will be referred as validation set.
